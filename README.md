# To Do List App

This project was created during my internship with Prodigy InfoTech.

## Features

The app allows the user to create tasks by typing in the textbox, add them and delete them by tapping the bin icon.

It is a handy, down-to-earth task management tool that can be used on any platform thanks to Flutter.

## Sample Image

Below is a typical view for the app.
